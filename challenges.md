# About the Code Challenges
We have a couple of code challenges designed to give you the opportunity to showcase your skills. We love to see creativity, originality and simplicity of design. All of our projects involve some creativity, research, interest in data, automation and of course amazing instructions. Please make sure to write the most incredible and informative README.md files you can imagine.

There are tons of amazing open and free data sets to play with. Here are a few for inspiration:

* [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/open-gov/)
* [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)
* [AWS Open Data](https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/)
* [OpenData Baltimore](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/)
* [Open Data Sets on GitHub](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/04/awesome-public-datasets-github.html)
* [Firebase Data Sets](https://www.firebase.com/docs/open-data/)

# Option #1: For the Front-End Enthusiast and JavaScript Afficianados
The assignment involves identifying a data set that has multiple orientations/dimensions. It should have time-orientation, as well as other dimensions that would make the data exciting and fun to explore with a charting/visualization library. There are lots of data sets out there on the market to play around. Simple data sets that may look at population attributes, economic growth (GDP), literacy or health, etc…from a global perspective over time. There are other data sets that are security oriented such as [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/) or [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/). The point is to find a data set to visualize in multiple dimensions or filters. Don’t put too much thought into the perfect data set. Find a data set that simply works and start building the application.

Once the data set is identified, we would like for you to create a simple interactive application that leverages the data set. The data can be reorganized however you like for storage purposes, as long as your code can successfully integrated or make use of the data. We would like this small web application to leverage a single web page framework like AngularJS or a similar framework. We would like for the application to make use of D3 for generating SVG format. We would like for you to leverage a charting library of your choice like NVD3, dc.JS, HighCharts, etc…for presenting, visualizing and interacting with the data. You may chose the Single Page Web Framework and charting library. We do want you to make use of D3.



# Option #2: For the Server Side Folks Who Are Willing to Walk on the Wild Side with a Little UI Work
We’ve put together an assignment that will help us see how well you can do from a middle-tier and front-end perspective. There’s an opportunity to work on the backend, but it’s not required as the data for this project can be stored in JSON. The goal of this assignment is to build a small application that will demonstrate programming skills in Java, building RESTful services, the build process, as well as front-end frameworks such as AngularJS. We also want to see some basic test automation (Unit and Integration).

Once the data set is identified, we would like for you to create a simple interactive application that leverages the data set. The data can be reorganized however you like for storage purposes, as long as your code can successfully integrated or make use of the data. The data should either be stored in a JSON file, stored relationally (MySQL preferred) or stored in a NoSQL storage system such as Casandra or MongDB. You will then need to create a simple web application that can read the data and then be sent to a REST client. The Java program should have Junit tests, as well as an integration test suite using RESTassured (a Java DSL for testing REST: https://github.com/jayway/rest-assured).

Inclusion of code comments, tests, etc… are helpful as well.



# Option #3: The Cloud Operations Guru Who Eats Unicorns for Breakfast

AirBnB has open sourced an really interesting and exciting data visualization platform called Caravel. Rather than have you build a visualization platform, we would like to see how well you can leverage an Open Source project. Your goal will be to customize the project by selecting an alternative data set. In addition, you will need to automate the provisioning, installation and setup of the project. No need to do any custom programming. We are hoping it is limited to adding a data set and automating. You really shouldn’t have to fork the project.

[Click Here for the Link](https://github.com/airbnb/caravel)

Identify a data set that would easily integrate with the Caravel application. (See their examples they use…try to find another data set that’s just as powerful as theirs)
Build the project so it’s up and running with your selected data set
Automate the project using a combination of Vagrant (virtualization purposes) and an automation language such as Ansible (provisioning purposes). Please use Ubuntu or Centos for the OS on Vagrant.
The work needs to be committed on Github with an appropriate README that anyone could follow in order to setup the application. Inclusion of code comments, tests, etc… are helpful as well.

It can be something completely different. The point is to find a data set to visualize in multiple dimensions or filters. Find a data set that is somewhat complex.
